## What is this repository for?

This repository contains useful shell scripts I use all the time. It's main
purpose is to have them all in one place and to provide documentation.

Scripts:
- **caps_to_esc.sh**: map caps-lock key to escape key.
- **gg.sh**: navigate github repositories 


## Installation

*caps_to_esc.sh*, *gg.sh*:

Just source them in your .bashrc, .bashrc_profile, .profile, etc.
Example:

    . gg.sh
